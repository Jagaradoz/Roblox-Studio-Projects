--  1. Character Movement                            : The client can move their own character, and the server (and others) will see it.
--  2. Physics Forces on Own Character               : BodyMovers or LinearVelocity applied locally to your character are replicated.
--  3. Animation on  Humanoid                        : Animations played locally on your character are seen by all.
--  4. Camera and Screen Effects                     : Only affect the clientâ€™s own view.
--  5. Humanoid State Transitions                    : State changes (jumping, swimming, etc.) controlled by the client are replicated.
--  6. Appearance Customization                      : Character clothing/accessory changes by the client replicate to others.
--  7. Sound Playback (own character)                : Sounds parented to your character may replicate; others are local only.
--  8. JumpPower / WalkSpeed                         : Can be changed by the client, but the server can override or reset them.
